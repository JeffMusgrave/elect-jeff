Every child should have the opportunity to develop their unique talents to the fullest. Your child deserves that opportunity, and that's why I am asking for your vote.

Am I qualified to be a school trustee? Absolutely! I am a husband and father. I have a background in website design and development, psychology, and music. And I have a multicultural perspective: My wife speaks Portuguese, and my mother speaks Japanese.

I firmly believe our schools should teach students the knowledge and skills they need for success. Our schools should also teach students to think critically. And our schools should keep parents informed about what their children are learning.

Please vote Jeff Musgrave for school trustee. Thank you!
