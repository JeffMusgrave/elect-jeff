          Am I qualified to be a school trustee? Absolutely! I am a husband and
          father. I have a background in website design and development,
          psychology, and music. And I have a multicultural perspective: My wife
          speaks Portuguese, and my mother speaks Japanese.
        </p>
        <p>
          I firmly believe our schools should teach students the knowledge and
          skills they need for success. Our schools should also teach students
          to think critically. And our schools should keep parents informed
          about what their children are learning.
        </p>
        <p>Please vote Jeff Musgrave for school trustee. Thank you!</p>
