    <h1>Vote Jeff Musgrave</h1>
    <p>
      Every child should have the opportunity to develop their unique talents to
      the fullest. Your child deserves that opportunity, and that's why I am
      asking for your vote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Am I qualified to be a school trustee? Absolutely! I am a husband and
      father. I have a background in website design and development, psychology,
      and music. And I have a multicultural perspective: My wife speaks
      Portuguese, and my mother speaks Japanese.
    </p>
    <p>
      I firmly believe our schools should teach students the knowledge and
      skills they need for success. Our schools should also teach students to
      think critically. And our schools should keep parents informed about what
      their children are learning.
    </p>
    <p>Please vote Jeff Musgrave for school trustee. Thank you!</p>
