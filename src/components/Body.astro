  <span class="italic font-bold">Every child</span> should have the opportunity to
  develop their unique talents to the fullest. Your child deserves that opportunity,
  and that's why I am asking for your vote.

  Am I qualified to be a school trustee? Absolutely! I am a husband and father.
  I have a background in website design and development, psychology, and music.
  And I have a multicultural perspective: My wife speaks Portuguese, and my
  mother speaks Japanese.
</p>
<p>
  I firmly believe our schools should teach students the knowledge and skills
  they need for success. Our schools should also teach students to think
  critically. And our schools should keep parents informed about what their
  children are learning.
</p>
<p class="mb-8">Please vote Jeff Musgrave for school trustee. Thank you!</p>
